                <p> Hello, welcome to this small website which shows off my skills in the world of
                    Information Technology. Please have a look at my on going projects, where a brief explanation for each is given below.<br><br>
                    I have used a range of languages in these projects; HTML, CSS, javascript, python and the dotnet framework. Databases used are microsoft SQL and MySQL.

                    This is an app that allows the user to make a quicker decision on where to go for fishing. It shows
                    the swell
                    forecast and tides for multiple fishing spots over multiple days, so it is easier to decided the
                    best place to go.
                    As a land based fisherman myself, it is important for safety to know the swell size and power so that you don't end up going out in dangerous conditions.<br><br>

                    <label>Users favourite spots are readily available</label><br><br>

                    <label>The user is able to alter the days shown, accomplished with javascript</label><br><br>

                    Currently this webapp has a login server which allows the user to save favourite fishing spots.
                    These spots forecast
                    conditions are updated constantly to ensure the latest information is always available. The user can
                    also search for
                    any fishing spots all over the world. This site gathers information from forecast sites using a
                    python webscraper,
                    while the interaction between client and server is through dotnet.</br></br>

                    When a fishing spot is searched or added to a user's favourite list it is added to a task list
                    table. The server is setup to periodically check this table and if a task is found, the python
                    script is started to find the requested spot's forecast. The forecast div is also periodically
                    refreshed to see if the data has been found yet, and populates it when found. These above steps only
                    occurs if the spot's forecast is not already found in the database, otherwise the prexisting data is
                    used instead.

                    Further down the track a user can keep track of their successes when fishing, and the site will
                    automatically include the forecast conditions that led that good fishing day. It will then alert
                    when similar conditions are around the corner so hopefully the user can get out there with the big
                    fish once again.</br></br>

                    The next features to be added is methods to organise fishing trips with a group easily, this will
                    pass on all
                    information such as conditions and weather to everyone invited and allows for alterations to the
                    plan by
                    everyone in the fishing group.</br></br>

                    Previously I created a PHP website that handled the social aspects of this, with the users being
                    able to add friends,
                    submit general posts, fishing reports, and comment on friends posts, and can be found on my github.
                    However, for the
                    backend architecture it was decided to change to dotnet. However, these original ideas are to soon
                    be implemented
                    into the new dotnet webapp.

                <h3>Accurate steel joint detailing, fast</h3>
                <h4><a ref="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MalcolmForster/Steel-Joint-Designer">Link
                        to GitHub
                        repository</a></h4>
                <p>
                    While doing my Structural Engineering Masters, I had a small play with coding in C#, and the Welded Joint Designer program is the
                    result of
                    that. The sizing calculations for steel connection can be quite tricky, and I believed that a
                    calculator
                    designed to help the engineer with this step will make it quicker and more accurate. The idea behind
                    this
                    program is to take the forces and moments from a SAP style software, which runs analysis on a
                    building or
                    section of a building, and produces a set of expected forces and moments on the joints. Using these results, my program will then size all the elements of the steel joints to ensure that they
                    conform to the
                    latest structural standards.<br><br>
                    <img src="images/WJDOutput.jpg" alt="WJDOutput" class="fitImage" />
                    <label>An example output, with an overview of the joint on the left, and location and size of welds on the right.</label><br><br>

                    There is both a simplified input method, where the engineer selects the style of joint from a drop
                    down list,
                    and the beginning of a more complex system where the engineer can 'draw' the joint to analyse. The
                    latter method
                    required interaction with a canvas object and connects beam and column lines with node points.
                    Further along in
                    the development, this information is then going to be analysed by the calculation portion of the
                    program to have
                    it's elements also sized.<br>

                <p>
                    To help backup my projects I created a simple synchronisation program. This is made in python and
                    use Tkinter to
                    render a GUI. This program walks through both a working folder and a backup folder and checks to see
                    if any
                    differences in directorys exist and files. New files are copied over, and deleted files are renamed
                    and sent to
                    obsolete folders in the backup directory.<br><br>

                    Most other files, except those which are selected to not be checked which I do not usually edit
                    (PDFs and
                    images),
                    are then compared via binary comparison. Originally this was done by MD5 hashing, and this method
                    still exists
                    in the
                    code, and will be reimplement as an option. The files which are found to have been altered are
                    copied across to
                    the backup, where the obsolete versions are moved to the obsolete folders.<br><br>

                    Future ideas for this program will be automatic synchronisation at a certain interval, and a method
                    to add
                    multiple
                    sync/backup locations. <br><br>

                    Ever wondered how you neighbour always seems to grow bigger tomatoes than you? This is no longer a
                    secret! Although in its beginning stages this webapp has the aim of letting you in on the world's
                    gardening secrets. Not only this, but it will aid keeping track of all steps of your gardening, such as when plants were fertilised or
                    havested. The idea behind this app is by using a vast amount of data from its users, predictions can
                    be made about when to plant and harvest or protect against hash weather. Recommendations can be made
                    as to other plants and vegetables a user can try based on the climate of their location and what other users are growing around them. Will then
                    look at expanding this idea to recommend where these plants can be purchased locally.</br></br>

                    This website is in its infancy but it will allow for the opportunity to learn about using client
                    location within an app. The aim is to use only dotnet architecture for the entire project.
