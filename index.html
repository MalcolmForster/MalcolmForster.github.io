                    Hello! And= welcome to this small website which shows off some of my skills in the world of Information Technology. 
                    Below I let you know a little about myself and where I plan of going with my career. For examples of my work, please visit the <a rel="noopener" href="/projects.html">Projects</a> page.<br><br>
                    I have used a range of languages including HTML, CSS, javascript, and python, but have now moved onto using the C#/dotnet framework and Azure.
                    I enjoy coding, and am always looking for ways to advance my career in this field and learn something new. Wether it is with programming itself, 
                    databases, devops, server management, security or cloud technology, I aim to learn something new every day.
                </p>

            <div class="section page-intro">                
                <div class="section bgHeader">
                    <h2>About me</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I am a kiwi programmer, and enjoy all things I.T. 
                    Although I was originally a Mechanical Engineer, I changed career path to the fantastic field of Information Technology! Having always enjoyed computers while growing up, 
                    including building and overclocking them, photoshop, networking, web design and programming, this switch in career was definitely the right choice. 
                    Knowadays, I enjoy projects which have a network element to them, and utilizing my home Linux server.<br/><br/>
                    When I am not coding I try my best to get away from the screen, hence why I enjoy going fishing when the weather suits and building/painting scale models.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section page-intro">                
                <div class="section bgHeader">
                    <h2>What am I up to?</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I am fortunate enough to have been selected to be part of the Summer of Cloud Azure course put on by the Summer of Tech/Sales Force. This is a fantastic opportunity for me to get some experience 
                    in the tech industry and learn about coding in a professional environment, with the added bonus of becoming Azure certified!<br/><br/>

                    I also have a few projects underway to help me learn more about the dotnet framework, the main of which being <a rel="noopener" rel="noopener" href="structcha.html">Structcha</a>. This aims to be a software environment 
                    that will aid to help the high paced world of the construction industry in New Zealand. Eventually it will offer a large range of products that cater to management, analysis, design and drafting of 
                    construction projects.<br/><br/>

                    This is an ambitious project that can be as large or small as I want it to be. However, I enjoy the freedom it allows me to come up with features that may not be the best suited for or practical for the Structcha environment, but simply to test my programming 
                    abilities, which drives me to learn.
