            <p>Hello, welcome to this small website which is meant to show the off my skills in the world of Information Technology.<br><br>
            Please check out the websites below. These were to help me understand and learn about how a webserver is run efficiently as well as the programming required for both frontend and backend development.<br><br>
            There are multiple databases in use, each customised to suit each website's purpose. A vast array of programming languages and development stacks have been used in these webpages to look into functionality, form and security. An explaination of each website is given in in the list below, as well as the methods used to create them.

            <p>Ever wondered how you neighbour always seems to grow bigger tomatoes than you? This is no longer a secret! Although in its beginning stages this webapp has the aim of letting you in on the worlds gardening secrets. Not only this, but it aims to aid you track when plants were fertilised or havested. The idea behind this app is by using a vast amount of data from its users, predictions can be made about when to plant and harvest or protect against hash weather. Recommendations can be made as to other plants and vegetables a user can try based on the climate of their locations. Will then look at expanding this idea to recommend where these can be purchased locally.</br></br>
