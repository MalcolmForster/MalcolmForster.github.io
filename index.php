            <h3>A website to access the websites and software designed and created by Malcolm Forster</h3>

            <p>Hello, welcome to this small website which is meant to show the off my skills in the world of Information Technology.<br><br>
            Please check out the websites below. These were to help me understand and learn about how a webserver is run efficiently as well as the programming required for both frontend and backend development.<br><br>
            There are multiple databases in use, each customised to suit each website's purpose. A vast array of programming languages and development stacks have been used in these webpages to look into functionality, form and security. An explaination of each website is given in in the list below, as well as the methods used to create them.
